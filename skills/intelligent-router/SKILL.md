# Intelligent Router — Core Skill

> **CORE SKILL**: This skill is infrastructure, not guidance. Installation = enforcement.
> Run `bash skills/intelligent-router/install.sh` to activate.

## What It Does

Automatically classifies any task into a tier (SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX/REASONING/CRITICAL)
and recommends the cheapest model that can handle it well.

**The problem it solves:** Without routing, every cron job and sub-agent defaults to Sonnet
(expensive). With routing, monitoring tasks use free local models, saving 80-95% on cost.

---

## MANDATORY Protocol (enforced via AGENTS.md)

### Before spawning any sub-agent:
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router.py classify "task description"
```

### Before creating any cron job:
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/spawn_helper.py "task description"
# Outputs the exact model ID and payload snippet to use
```

### To validate a cron payload has model set:
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/spawn_helper.py --validate '{"kind":"agentTurn","message":"..."}'
```

### ❌ VIOLATION (never do this):
```python
# Cron job without model = Sonnet default = expensive waste
{"kind": "agentTurn", "message": "check server..."}  # ← WRONG
```

### ✅ CORRECT:
```python
# Always specify model from router recommendation
{"kind": "agentTurn", "message": "check server...", "model": "ollama/glm-4.7-flash"}
```

## Tier System

| Tier | Use For | Primary Model | Cost |
|------|---------|---------------|------|
| 🟢 SIMPLE | Monitoring, heartbeat, checks, summaries | `anthropic-proxy-6/glm-4.7` (alt: proxy-4) | $0.50/M |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Code fixes, patches, research, data analysis | `nvidia-nim/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` | $0.40/M |
| 🟠 COMPLEX | Features, architecture, multi-file, debug | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | $3/M |
| 🔵 REASONING | Proofs, formal logic, deep analysis | `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking` | $1/M |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Security, production, high-stakes | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` | $5/M |

**SIMPLE fallback chain:** `anthropic-proxy-4/glm-4.7` → `nvidia-nim/qwen/qwen2.5-7b-instruct` ($0.15/M)

> ⚠️ **`ollama-gpu-server` is BLOCKED** for cron/spawn use. Ollama binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — unreachable over LAN from the OpenClaw host. The `router_policy.py` enforcer will reject any payload referencing it.

**Tier classification uses 4 capability signals (not cost alone):**
- `effective_params` (50%) — extracted from model ID or `known-model-params.json` for closed-source models
- `context_window` (20%) — larger = more capable
- `cost_input` (20%) — price as quality proxy (weak signal, last resort for unknown sizes)
- `reasoning_flag` (10%) — bonus for dedicated thinking specialists (R1, QwQ, Kimi-K2)

---

## Policy Enforcer (NEW in v3.2.0)

`router_policy.py` catches bad model assignments **before they are created**, not after they fail.

### Validate a cron payload before submitting
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router_policy.py check \
  '{"kind":"agentTurn","model":"ollama-gpu-server/glm-4.7-flash","message":"check server"}'
# Output: VIOLATION: Blocked model 'ollama-gpu-server/glm-4.7-flash'. Recommended: anthropic-proxy-6/glm-4.7
```

### Get enforced model recommendation for a task
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router_policy.py recommend "monitor alphastrike service"
# Output: Tier: SIMPLE  Model: anthropic-proxy-6/glm-4.7

python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router_policy.py recommend "monitor alphastrike service" --alt
# Output: Tier: SIMPLE  Model: anthropic-proxy-4/glm-4.7  ← alternate key for load distribution
```

### Audit all existing cron jobs
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router_policy.py audit
# Scans all crons, reports any with blocked or missing models
```

### Show blocklist
```bash
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/router_policy.py blocklist
```

### Policy rules enforced
1. **Model must be set** — no model field = Sonnet default = expensive waste
2. **No blocked models** — `ollama-gpu-server/*` and bare `ollama/*` are rejected for cron use
3. **CRITICAL tasks** — warns if using a non-Opus model for classified-critical work

## Installation (Core Skill Setup)

Run once to self-integrate into AGENTS.md:
```bash
bash skills/intelligent-router/install.sh
```

This patches AGENTS.md with the mandatory protocol so it's always in context.

## Scoring System

15-dimension weighted scoring (not just keywords):

1. **Reasoning markers** (0.18) — prove, theorem, derive
2. **Code presence** (0.15) — code blocks, file extensions
3. **Multi-step patterns** (0.12) — first...then, numbered lists
4. **Agentic task** (0.10) — run, fix, deploy, build
5. **Technical terms** (0.10) — architecture, security, protocol
6. **Token count** (0.08) — complexity from length
7. **Creative markers** (0.05) — story, compose, brainstorm
8. **Question complexity** (0.05) — multiple who/what/how
9. **Constraint count** (0.04) — must, require, exactly
10. **Imperative verbs** (0.03) — analyze, evaluate, audit
11. **Output format** (0.03) — json, table, markdown
12. **Simple indicators** (0.02) — check, get, show (inverted)
13. **Domain specificity** (0.02) — acronyms, dotted notation
14. **Reference complexity** (0.02) — "mentioned above"
15. **Negation complexity** (0.01) — not, never, except

Confidence: `1 / (1 + exp(-8 × (score - 0.5)))`

## Config

Models defined in `config.json`. Add new models there, router picks them up automatically.
Local Ollama models have zero cost — always prefer them for SIMPLE tasks.

---

## Auto-Discovery (Self-Healing)

The intelligent-router can **automatically discover working models** from all configured providers via **real live inference tests** (not config-existence checks).

### How It Works

1. **Provider Scanning:** Reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → finds all models
2. **Live Inference Test:** Sends `"hi"` to each model, checks it actually responds (catches auth failures, quota exhaustion, 404s, timeouts)
3. **OAuth Bypass:** Providers with `sk-ant-oat01-*` tokens (Anthropic OAuth) are skipped in raw HTTP — OpenClaw refreshes these transparently, so they're always marked available
4. **Thinking Model Support:** Models that return `content=None` + `reasoning_content` (GLM-4.7, Kimi-K2, Qwen3-thinking) are correctly detected as available
5. **Auto-Classification:** Tiers assigned via `tier_classifier.py` using 4 capability signals
6. **Config Update:** Removes unavailable models, rebuilds tier primaries from working set
7. **Cron:** Hourly refresh (cron id: `a8992c1f`) keeps model list current, alerts if availability changes by >2

### Usage

```bash
# One-time discovery
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/discover_models.py

# Auto-update config with working models only
python3 skills/intelligent-router/scripts/discover_models.py --auto-update

# Set up hourly refresh cron
openclaw cron add --job '{
  "name": "Model Discovery Refresh",
  "schedule": {"kind": "every", "everyMs": 3600000},
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "Run: bash skills/intelligent-router/scripts/auto_refresh_models.sh",
    "model": "ollama/glm-4.7-flash"
  }
}'
```

### Benefits

✅ **Self-healing:** Automatically removes broken models (e.g., expired OAuth)
✅ **Zero maintenance:** No manual model list updates
✅ **New models:** Auto-adds newly released models
✅ **Cost optimization:** Always uses cheapest working model per tier

### Discovery Output

Results saved to `skills/intelligent-router/discovered-models.json`:

```json
{
  "scan_timestamp": "2026-02-19T21:00:00",
  "total_models": 25,
  "available_models": 23,
  "unavailable_models": 2,
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "available": 2,
      "unavailable": 0,
      "models": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Pinning Models

To preserve a model even if it fails discovery:

```json
{
  "id": "special-model",
  "tier": "COMPLEX",
  "pinned": true  // Never remove during auto-update
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Gap — Proactive Health-Based Routing (2026-03-04)
Current router is **reactive** not **proactive**:
- Fallback only fires AFTER a 429 is received
- No awareness of concurrent sessions on same proxy
- No cooldown tracking after rate-limit events

**Needed improvements:**
1. Track last-429 timestamp per provider → skip if within cooldown window
2. Track active concurrent spawns per provider → if >1 active, route to OAuth
3. Before spawning N parallel agents, check if single provider can handle N concurrent
4. Expose `router.get_best_available(n_concurrent=2)` API
